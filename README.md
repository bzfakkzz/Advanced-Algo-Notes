# Advanced-Algo-Notes

> "Algorithms are not just lines of code; they are the crystallization of logic and the shadow of thinking."

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive of algorithmic retrospectives, theoretical summaries, and error analyses accumulated during my undergraduate years.

Unlike standard competitive programming libraries that focus solely on "clean templates," this collection emphasizes **the thinking process**. It documents the pitfalls, edge cases, and logical corrections encountered during my training for the **CCPC (China Collegiate Programming Contest)**.

Each `.md` file represents a specific algorithmic topic where I once stumbled, reflected, and eventually found clarity.

## Content Structure

The notes are categorized by algorithmic paradigms, focusing on high-frequency and complex topics encountered in high-level contests.

### Dynamic Programming (The Core)
My focus on DP stems from its requirement for rigorous state definition and transition logic.
* **`DP_区间dp.md`**: Analysis of Interval DP patterns and complexity optimization.
* **`DP_换根dp.md`**: Re-rooting techniques for tree-based problems.
* **`DP_数位dp.md`**: Handling constraints on digits and large numbers.
* **`DP_状压dp.md`**: State compression techniques using bitmasks.
* **`DP_期望dp.md`**: Probability and expected value problems.
* **`DP_计数dp.md`**: Combinatorics and counting principles within DP.

### Graph Theory & Search
* **`BFS.md` / `DFS.md`**: Beyond the basics — exploring search pruning, bidirectional search, and state-space search optimization.

## Philosophy: Why "Retrospectives"?

In the journey of competitive programming, getting an `Accepted` verdict is just the beginning. 

I believe that **analyzing a "Wrong Answer" is often more valuable than a correct one.** This repository is my "Error Book" (错题集). It records:
1.  **Misconceptions:** Why my initial intuition was wrong.
2.  **Corner Cases:** The subtle boundaries that break the logic.
3.  **Optimization:** How to bridge the gap between $O(N^2)$ and $O(N \log N)$.
